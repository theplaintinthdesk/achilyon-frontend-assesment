# Travel & Tour Booking Landing Page

## Project Description
This project is a modern, high-performance web application built with **Next.js 16** designed as a comprehensive landing page for a travel and tour agency. It showcases dynamic travel packages, popular destinations, and company values through a responsive and interactive user interface. The application mimics a full-stack environment by utilizing Next.js API routes to serve dynamic content for tours, destinations, and search functionality, as well as handling booking form submissions.

## Key Features
-   **Dynamic Tour & Destination Carousels:** Features auto-playing, interactive carousels powered by Embla Carousel to showcase featured tours and popular destinations.
-   **API-Driven Content:** All critical data—including tour listings, destination highlights, company statistics, and "reasons to travel"—is served dynamically via local Next.js API routes.
-   **Advanced Tour Search & Filtering:** A dedicated API endpoint (`/api/search`) allows users to filter tours based on destination, trip duration (days), price range, and dates.
-   **Booking Simulation:** Includes a functional booking API (`/api/bookings`) that validates user input and simulates processing tour reservation requests.
-   **Responsive Mobile-First Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS v4 to ensure a seamless experience across mobile devices, tablets, and desktop screens.
-   **Modern UI Architecture:** Utilizes **Shadcn UI** and **Radix UI** primitives for accessible, robust components like Cards, Buttons, and Carousels.

## Technology Stack & Libraries
-   **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4, Tailwind Merge, CLSX, TW Animate CSS
-   **UI Components:** Shadcn UI, Radix UI (@radix-ui/react-slot)
-   **Icons:** Lucide React
-   **Animations/Interactivity:** Embla Carousel (React & Autoplay)
-   **Linting:** ESLint

## Project Structure
-   **`app/`**: Contains the core application routing logic using the Next.js App Router.
-   **`app/api/`**: Houses all backend API route handlers (search, bookings, tours, etc.) that serve data to the frontend.
-   **`components/`**: Custom React components specific to this project, such as `TourCards`, `DiscoveriesCards`, and `ReasonCard`.
-   **`components/ui/`**: Reusable, atomic UI components generated by Shadcn UI (e.g., `button.tsx`, `carousel.tsx`, `card.tsx`).
-   **`lib/`**: Contains utility functions, primarily `utils.ts` for efficient class name merging.

## Data Architecture & Decisions

This section outlines the reasoning behind the data structures chosen for the API and frontend state.

### 1. Typed Arrays for Mock Databases
**Files:** `app/api/tours/route.ts`, `app/api/destinations/route.ts`
*   **Choice:** We utilize constant Arrays of Typed Objects (e.g., `Tour[]`, `Destination[]`) to simulate database tables.
*   **Reasoning:** This structure provides immediate, synchronous access to data without the overhead of a database connection, which is ideal for a landing page or prototype. It allows for O(n) filtering and searching, which is performant at this scale.

### 2. Pre-formatted Currency Strings
**Files:** `app/api/tours/route.ts`
*   **Structure:** Prices are stored as strings (e.g., `"$11,799.00"`) rather than raw numbers.
*   **Reasoning:** While storing numbers is standard for databases, storing pre-formatted strings ensures display consistency across the UI without requiring currency formatting logic in every component.
*   **Trade-off:** In `api/search/route.ts`, we implement a parsing utility to strip symbols (`$`, `,`) to perform numeric comparisons (`minPrice`, `maxPrice`) during filtering.

### 3. Dynamic Icon Mapping (String-to-Component)
**Files:** `app/api/reasons/route.ts`, `app/page.tsx`
*   **Structure:** The API returns an `icon` property as a string (e.g., `"UserCheck"`, `"Leaf"`) rather than SVGs or HTML.
*   **Reasoning:** You cannot serialize React components or functions over JSON API responses. Sending a string identifier keeps the payload lightweight and secure. The frontend (`ReasonsSection` in `page.tsx`) maintains a registry map (`getIconComponent`) to hydrate these strings into actual Lucide React components at runtime.

## Component-Data Integration

The application follows a strictly unidirectional data flow. This table illustrates how frontend components consume specific API datasets.

| UI Component | Data Source (API) | Mapping Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Header` (Carousel)** | `GET /api/tours` | **List Rendering:** The component fetches the `Tour[]` array and maps each item to a `<TourCards />` component. Properties like `title`, `image`, and `days` are passed directly as props. |
| **`DestinationsSection`** | `GET /api/destinations` | **List Rendering:** Fetches `Destination[]`. Maps `title` and `image` to the `<DiscoveriesCards />` component within an auto-playing carousel. |
| **`ReasonsSection`** | `GET /api/reasons` | **Hydration Mapping:** Fetches `Reason[]`. Uses a switch statement to convert the API's `icon` string (e.g., "Binoculars") into the corresponding imported Lucide Icon component before passing it to `<ReasonCard />`. |
| **`Search Logic`** | `GET /api/search` | **Query Param Filtering:** The frontend constructs a URL with query params (e.g., `?minDays=10`). The API parses these params to filter the mock data array and returns a new subset of tours. |

## API Endpoints
The application uses the following internal API routes to manage data and user interactions:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description | Parameters / Body |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/tours` | Fetches a list of all featured tours. | N/A |
| `GET` | `/api/tours/[id]` | Fetches details for a specific tour by ID. | **Param:** `id` (string) |
| `GET` | `/api/destinations` | Retrieves a list of popular travel destinations. | N/A |
| `GET` | `/api/reasons` | Fetches the "Reasons to Travel" value propositions. | N/A |
| `GET` | `/api/stats` | Retrieves company statistics (e.g., total travelers). | N/A |
| `GET` | `/api/search` | Filters tours based on specific criteria. | **Query Params:** `destination`, `minDays`, `maxDays`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `date` |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings` | Submits a new booking request. | **Body:** `{ "name": string, "email": string, "tourId": string, "message"?: string }` |
